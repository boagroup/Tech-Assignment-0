# Bartosz's Solution
# because some tasks don't specify a directory nor file I use $DIRECTORY and $FILE to make the solutions make sense

# 1: create a file called rain.txt. Put the text 'speculate surprise relative regret evaluate' in it and copy it so there is also a rider.txt with same content
echo 'speculate surprise relative regret evaluate' >> rain.txt. >> rider.txt

# 2: create a file called degree.txt. Put the text 'panel sister ditch panel needle' in it and copy it so there is also a support.txt with same content
echo 'panel sister ditch panel needle' >> degree.txt. >> support.txt

# 3: output what's in the directory
ls

# 4: output the content of any file in the directory
cat $FILE
